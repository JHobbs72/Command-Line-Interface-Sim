# Command Line Interface Simulator

This game is designed to simulate a command line interface (CLI) so that those starting to learn how to use a CLI can practice commands in a contained environment. It is abstracted to a level suitable for the application, as such some commands and features have limited functionality. This is not deemed an issue as it is encouraged to move on to a real CLI as soon as some confidence is gained in order to understand a true system.
